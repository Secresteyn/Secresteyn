- 👋 Hi, I’m @Secresteyn

- 👀 I’m interested in Blender3D, Procedural Systems, Open Source Software and Game Design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, C# and Godot.

- I am currently actively working on a new addOn for Blender 3D that leverages Python, GeoNodes, Modular components and procedural generation scripts to expand design possibilities and greatly reduce production times.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Blender Addons, Open Source Game Development, GameJams.
- 📫 How to reach me:  Feel free to DM me on Itch.IO, Discord, or X.
